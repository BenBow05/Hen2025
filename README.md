## Inspiration
    We were inspired by the fact that communities don't always have easy access to view incidents in their local areas and makes reports so others would know. Additionally, we wanted to find a way to streamline and help reduce calls to emergency services for lower severity incidents and if it's a high severity incident forward them to call 911.
## What it does
    It allows users to view and create incident reports in their local area and get advice for themself or others on how to take proper precautions to stay safe. Additionally, there is a chat feature to discuss with a chat bot on whether its better to report something to our site or to proper service first.
## How we built it
    We used Gemini, React, JS, CSS, and Pocketbase to make a fullstack application to handle data creation and manipulation and user interaction.
## Challenges we ran into
    We ran into big challenges with styling with CSS due to us not using basic CSS in a long time and not having a lot of time to style.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
    We are proud of the simple design and the AI integration that allows for the severity labeling and allowing the user ask basic questions.
## What we learned
    We learned how to integrate Gemini API and use Pocketbase as the back-end. We learned how to plan quickly as a team to try to make a quality app.
## What's next for CrimeScope
    Adding a chatbot to allow users to ask basic questions on reporting and steps to take. Update the UI to make it more user friendly and add table sorting to allow for the user to search information.
